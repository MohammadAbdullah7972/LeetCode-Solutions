 *
 * [1] Two Sum
 * [Array/ Easy]
 * 
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
 * 
 * Approach: Brute Force
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - Nested loops checking all possible pairs
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - No additional space used except for result
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * This solution uses a brute force approach with nested loops to check every
 * possible pair of numbers in the array. The outer loop runs from the first
 * element to the last, while the inner loop runs from the current element of
 * the outer loop to the end. When a pair summing to the target is found,
 * their indices are returned immediately.
 * 
 * Note: While simple, this approach is not optimal for large arrays. A more
 * efficient O(n) solution would use a HashMap to store seen values.
